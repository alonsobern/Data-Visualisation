# Human Resources - Power BI

### 📝 Overview
This dataset contains information about employees in a company, including their work history, demographics, and employment-related factors in the context of human resources and employee management. This synthetic dataset mirrors the structure and characteristics of real employee data, while all the information contained within is entirely fictional and generated for illustrative purposes.

Using Power BI, I have developed dashboards to get insights based on demographics analysis where can observe the trends in terms of age, ethnicity, or gender through different departments or business units.
