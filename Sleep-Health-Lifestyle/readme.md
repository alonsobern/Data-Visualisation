# Sleep Health and Lifestyle - Power BI

### 📝 Overview
The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset comprises 400 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits. It includes details such as gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity level, stress levels, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders.

Using Power BI, I have developed a dashboard which allow us to analyse the comprehensive sleep metrics, sleep disorders, lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular health.
